    <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 200°F (95°C).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Generously season all sides of the steak with salt and pepper.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Transfer to a wire rack on top of a baking sheet, then bake for about 45 minutes to an
        hour until the internal temperature reads about 125°F (51° C) for medium-rare. Adjust the bake time based on if
        you like your steak more rare or more well-done (you monster).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Heat the canola oil in a pan over high heat until smoking. Do not use olive oil, as its
        smoke point is significantly lower than that of canola oil and will smoke before reaching the desired cooking
        temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Sear the steak for 30 seconds on the first side, then flip.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Add the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme and swirl around the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> Transfer the garlic and herbs on top of the steak and baste the steak with the butter
        using a large spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong> Baste for about 30 seconds, then flip and baste the other side for about 15 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong> Turn the steak on its side and cook to render off any excess fat.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 10:</strong> Rest the steak on a cutting board or wire rack for about 10 minutes. Slicing the steak
        before the resting period has finished will result in a lot of the juices leaking out, which may not be
        desirable.Slice the steak into ½ -inch (1 cm) strips, then fan out the slices and serve.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 11:</strong> Slice the steak into ½ -inch (1 cm) strips, then fan out the slices and serve.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 12:</strong> Enjoy!

    <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Cut the whole chickens into 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 legs and 4 wings and set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Preheat your oil, in either a heavy pan on the stove or a deep-fryer, to 325 degrees F.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and
        cayenne pepper until thoroughly mixed. Set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour the buttermilk into another bowl large enough for the chicken to be immersed in
        the buttermilk.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Prepare your dredging station. Place your chicken in a bowl. Next to that, your bowl of
        buttermilk, and next to that, your dry mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Take your breasts, lightly dust them with your flour mixture, then dip them in the
        buttermilk until they are coated, and then place them in the flour mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> Take the breasts that are in the flour mixture and aggressively push the flour mixture
        into the wet chicken. Make sure that the chicken in very thoroughly coated, or you will not achieve the crust
        and crunch you are looking for. Gently place the breasts in your hot oil.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong> Next, repeat the dredging steps with your other pieces of chicken in this order: thigh,
        leg then wing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong> When you place the last wing into the fryer, you should have 16 pieces of chicken in
        the oil. Set a timer for 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 10:</strong> After 15 minutes, take a probe thermometer and check the temperature of a breast. If
        it reads 180 degrees F, all of your chicken is done. (Keep in mind that it will continue to cook after it has
        been removed from the fryer.)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 11:</strong> Remove the chicken from the oil and let it drain for 5 minutes. Let cool for an
        additional 10 minutes before serving.
